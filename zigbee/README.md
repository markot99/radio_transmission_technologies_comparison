# ZigBee

The code only works on the FireBeetle 2 from DFRobot.

When trying out the example, make sure that the following settings are set in Arduino under Tools:

- Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload: "Enabled"
- Parition Scheme: "Zigbee 4MB with spiffs"


When using the client:
- Zigbee Mode: "Zigbee ED (end device)"


When using the server:
- Zigbee Mode: "Zigbee ZCZR (coordinator)"
